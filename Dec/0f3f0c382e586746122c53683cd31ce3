Russia said it had thwarted terrorism attacks reportedly planned in
St Petersburg thanks to a tip from Washington, bringing personal thanks
again from President Vladimir Putin to his US counterpart Donald Trump. Russian news agencies cited the Federal Security Service (FSB) as
saying that thanks to the information, two Russians were detained on
December 27 on suspicion of plotting attacks during New Year festivities
in St Petersburg. The Kremlin said Putin passed on his gratitude to Trump during a
phone call yesterday for the tip from US special services. It gave no
more details. Diplomatic ties between Washington and Moscow are fraught over
disagreements from Ukraine to Syria and allegations of Russian meddling
in the US presidential election, but Trump and Putin have managed to
keep personal lines open. Two years ago, the Russian leader also phoned Trump to thank him for a
tip that Russia said helped prevent a bomb attack on a cathedral in St
Petersburg. Russia has repeatedly been the target of attacks by militant
groups including Islamic State. Yesterday’s Kremlin statement said Putin and Trump agreed to continue bilateral cooperation to tackle terrorism. — Reuters Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa.
