According to him, the former broadcaster was a dedicated staff who
gave his all in the discharge of his duties during his brief time as a
legislative aide. Until his demise, Mudiaga Asagba, an ace broadcaster whose
professional experience traversed both radio and television, was a
Special Assistant on Media to the Deputy President of the Senate. While praying for the repose of the soul of Asagba, Omo-Agege prayed
God to grant his family and loved ones the fortitude to bear such
irreparable loss. “I receive the news of the sudden death of Mr. Mudiaga Asagba with a
heavy heart; he was not only passionate about the job but also gave his
all. “He will be greatly missed. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this trying time,” Omo-Agege said. Mudiaga Asagba passed on in Abuja in the early hours of Monday at the age of 52. Asagba was a former broadcaster with the Delta Rainbow Television
(DRTV) in Warri, before he voluntarily resigned and joined the services
of Quest FM and Television Station in Otor-Ogor, Ughelli North Local
Government Area of Delta State. He also worked with WE FM and Classic FM stations in Abuja. (NAN) Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
