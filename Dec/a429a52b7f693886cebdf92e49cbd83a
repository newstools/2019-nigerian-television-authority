The President salutes the commitment, hard work and doggedness that saw Omoyajowo through many milestones in life, including being a trained teacher, a graduate of Religious Studies at the University of Ibadan, a lecturer in the same institution, and ultimately a Professor at the then University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University). President Buhari commends the adept way Professor Omoyajowo combined academics with service in Godâ€™s vineyard, blending deep piety with teaching and research, and excelling in both.As he turns 85, the President wishes the retired cleric and university don good health, sound mind and continued strength, to be of further service to God and humanity.
