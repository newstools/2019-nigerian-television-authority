The Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, has cautioned
police operatives, especially those detailed to man highways during the
Yuletide against misconduct. The Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), DCP Frank Mba, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja. The IGP also warned operatives against abuse of rights of Nigerians
and called for adherence to laid down rules and standard operating
procedures of the force. He said that reported cases of unprofessionalism, including extortion
and intimidation of road users would be investigated and punished. The IGP directed Zonal Assistant Inspector General of Police and
Commissioners of Police in charge of commands to strengthen crime
prevention strategies in their jurisdictions. He said that the directive was to ensure peaceful and hitch-free
Christmas and New Year Celebrations, adding that the force had beefed up
security across the country. Adamu called for effective deployment of human and material assets of
the force to protect major highways, recreational centres, motor parks,
places of worship, financial institutions and Government/Private
Infrastructure. “In addition the supervisory officers must ensure that they are
personally on ground to monitor and supervise the officers and men under
their watch for optimal performance,” he said. The IGP expressed gratitude to Nigerians for their unwavering support
to the Police and other security agencies throughout the year. (NAN) Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa. Iam a graduate of Mass Communication with special interest on social media and Online Editor and a Reporter.
