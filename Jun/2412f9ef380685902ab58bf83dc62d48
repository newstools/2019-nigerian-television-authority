The Federal Government has called on Nigerians to disregard the
false information being circulated that fee is being collected from
ministerial appointment lobbyists to submit Curriculum Vitae. Mr Olusegun Adekunle, Permanent Secretary, General Services Office in  the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF),  made the call in a statement of Friday in Abuja. He said that the attention of the SGF had been drawn to the  information being circulated, requesting interested Nigerians to submit  their Curriculum Vitae for selection as cabinet members. Adekunle said that the false information had requested members of the
public to submit their profiles at a fee to a non-existing office in
the Office of the SGF. “The general public is advised to disregard such information as the
Office of the SGF has no such mandate and has not requested for such
information. “The originators of such false news are therefore, warned to desist
from using the name of the SGF in their dubious and nefarious activities
to fleece unsuspecting members of the public,” he said.
