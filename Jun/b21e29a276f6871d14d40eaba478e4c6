Sen. Bode Ola, a lawmaker in the 6th Assembly and Chieftain of All  Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti has urged President Muhammad Buhari  to order the immediate release of the June 12,1993 election results  annulled by the military government. The party chieftain, who represented Ekiti Central Senatorial  District disclosed this on Wednesday in Abuja, during an interview with  the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He said the release of the results would help put Nigeria’s political
history and records in proper perspective and right the wrongs of the
past. He added that by authourising the release of the results, the late
MKO Abiola would legally and officially be recognised as the authentic
winner of the controversial election. “President Buhari should go a step further by authorising the release
of the results of the June 12 1993 elections to officially and legally
authenticate M.K.O Abiola as the true winner of the contest. “The release of the results of the election would put the country’s
political history in proper perspectives and right the wrongs done to
millions of Nigerians who forgot ethnic and religious affiliation to
vote for M.K.O Abiola as President in the annulled 1993 polls, ” he
said. He, however,  commended the president for naming the National Stadium, Abuja after the late business mogul. Ola described the gesture as a way of immortalising Abiola’s name in
the annals of the nation’s history and engraving his name as the pillar
of sports in Africa. (NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.  I currently serve as I.T Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network NTA
