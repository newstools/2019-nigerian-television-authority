 Netherlands striker Lieke Martens was hurt while celebrating her  late winning goal against Japan in the womenâ€™s World Cup last 16,  putting her at risk of missing the quarter-final against Italy on  Saturday. Martens, who was named player of the year by FIFA in 2017 when the
Dutch won the European Championship, sat out training on Friday for a
second successive day with a painful foot. The injury developed after team mate Jill Roord jumped on her foot when they were celebrating. The 26-year-old Martens had a largely quiet tournament before bursting into the limelight on Tuesday. She scored both goals, the second from the penalty spot as the Dutch edged the 2011 World Cup winners 2-1 at Rennes. But her chances of playing against Italy looked bleak after she was  unable to train again on Friday, just hours after telling reporters she  was confident of playing.
