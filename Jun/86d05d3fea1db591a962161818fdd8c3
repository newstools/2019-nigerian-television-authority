Commenting on the development, Analysts at the FSDH Merchant Bank said: “The
major driver of the increase in the inflation rate in May was the increase
recorded in the Food Index. This is in line with the historical trend driven by
the commencement of raining and planting season. “The rising security
challenges in recent weeks in Nigeria have added to the escalating food prices.
On the policy implication, the analysts at FSDH said; “We believe the Central
Bank of Nigeria (CBN) may not increase the policy rates to curb the rising
inflation rate;  The CBN may however,
raise the Treasury Bill rates at the secondary market (OMO) to mop up liquidity
from the financial market until inflation rate begins to go down. “FSDH
Research believes the immediate priority of the federal government of Nigeria
and the CBN is to achieve inclusive growth momentum in the economy through an
expansion the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the CBN may trade off inflation
for growth in the short-term.” Analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited
stated: “We expect inflation rate to increase further as indicated by recent
build up in monthly price increases, especially against the backdrop of ongoing
planting season as well as anticipated increase in spending activity following
the implementation of the new minimum wage bill”.
