The Nigeria Maritime Administrative and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has  donated relief materials worth millions of naira to Anambra government  for distribution to communities affected by the 2018 flood in the state. The Director-General of the agency, Dr. Dakuku Peterside, presented the  materials to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) at Agu-Awka on  Friday. The relief items included bags of rice, garri, maize, noodles, disinfectants, soap, diapers, grinders and sewing machines. Peterside, who was represented by the Auditor-General of the agency, Mr  Victor Onuzulike, expressed the need for the Anambra government to  ensure proper distribution of the items to the affected persons. Chief Paul Odenigbo, the Executive Secretary of SEMA, who received the  materials, thanked NIMASA for showing genuine concern about the plight  of the flood victims in the state. Odenigbo also thanked other organisations, including the Red Cross and  National Emergency Management Agency, for making similar donations to  the victims in the past. He appealed to NIMASA to include Anambra in its 2019 intervention  programme in view of the prediction by the Nigeria Metrological Agency  that the state might also experience flooding this year.
