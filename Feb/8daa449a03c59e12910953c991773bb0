The Social Democratic Party in Ughelli South Local Government of Delta State, has disclosed that the party was not supporting any other APC candidate apart from President Muhammadu Buhari. The party in a statement issued on Tuesday by its Chairman, Mr. Jonathan Idoro, the party denied throwing it’s weight behind the All Progressive Congress, APC House of Reps’s candidate, Francis Waive. It said that it remained strongly in support of SDP’s candidate, Hon. Solomon Awhinawhi, a serving lawmaker at the national parliament. According to Idoro, the understanding reached by SDP at the National level only starts and ends with supporting President Muhammadu Buhari only for the presidential election. He, however, cautioned that any SDP member caught endorsing any other party’s candidate will be dealt with through application of proper sanctions. “Following concerns raised recently, the Social Democratic Party in Ughelli South Local Government wishes to state that at no time did the party endorse or support the APC’s house of reps candidate, Francis Waive. “Let it be made clear that we stand strongly behind our candidate, Hon. Solomon Awhinawhi, a serving member who is contesting to represent Udu, Ughelli South and Ughelli North federal constituency. “We also wish to draw the attention of all members of the party that going forward, any attempt to work against the collective interest of the party will attract sanctions in accordance with the provisions of the party’s constitution. “The understanding reached by the National body of our party to support the Presidential candidate of the APC, President Muhammadu Buhari, was done owing to the inability of our party to present a presidential candidate in good time,” it said.
