The Commissioner of Police in Enugu State, Mr Balarabe Suleiman, said  on Saturday that Enugu State recorded impressive security during the hours of the Presidential and National Assembly elections. Suleiman disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) after his election duty tour in Enugu. He, however, said that there was no recorded violence in the state, as little pockets of disagreements were resolved by the electoral umpire  amicably. “There was no record of any arrest so far as the electorate abided by the rule of law as well as the electoral Act,’’ he said. Suleiman also thanked other sister security agencies for their robust
partnership and collaboration during the period of the elections. “I must commend the patriotic attitude of the people of the state in exercising their civic rights in an impressive turnout. “Also, I will laud the media in the state for informing the public
rightly as well as helping in mobilizing them for the elections
proper,’’ he said. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services. Henry is also proficient in use of most online journalism tools and Social media management. He currently serve as Information Technology Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network.
