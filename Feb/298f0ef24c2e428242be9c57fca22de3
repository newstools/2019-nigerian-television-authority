The
Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says 400,000 Permanent
Voters Cards (PVCs) were yet to be collected out of the 3,215, 273
registered in the state. Mr
Enabor Edwin,  the Head of INEC  Voter Education and Publicity
Department in Rivers, Said this in an interview with the News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Port Harcourt. Edwin said that the commission had received a total of 3,118,638 PVCs from Abuja. He said that about 96,735 cards were yet to be received from the commission’s headquarters. “About
2, 700541 voters have collected their PVCs in the state and we have
about 4,18097 individual cards yet to be collected at the Local
Government Areas as at Jan. 31. “Collection of PVCs is still ongoing in the state at the various LGAs,’’ he said. Edwin
said that relocation, deaths and transfers of workers could be some of
the challenges that could affect the collection of PVCs before the
deadline of Feb. 8. He said that registered voters were expected to go to their various LGAs for collection of their cards. “We
expect that everybody that is registered should personally go and
collect their cards from their various  LGAs,’’  Edwin said. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
