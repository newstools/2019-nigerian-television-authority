 Mr Emeka Ejide, Coordinator of  State Child Rights Act Implementation  Committee (SCRAIC), has called for translation of the Child Rights Act  and the State Child Rights Law, into local languages. Ejide made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Awka. He said that translating the laws into a common language would help
in quality sensitisation of the populace, on the importance of
protecting the rights of the Child. Ejide, a retired Director of Child Development in Anambra Ministry of
Social Welfare, Children and Women Affairs, said the law
when simplified would help literate and illiterate to understand
importance of the law and abide by it. He said that if the Child Rights Act was translated into local
languages, it would also help the committee to further inculcate the
message into the consciousness of the people in a manner most effective. Ejide said that the committee was determined to enlighten the
populace on the importance of the Child Right Act and encourage people
to bring useful reports that would aid to fight the abuse of the law. He said that the committee has put machinery in place that would aid
the committee in getting information on those flouting the Act, for
legal prosecution. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services. Henry is also proficient in use of most online journalism tools and Social media management. He currently serve as Information Technology Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network.
