Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has dismissed a trending social media fake news alert suggesting his resignation in the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.Osinbajo’s spokeman, Laolu Akande, in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, said the vice president gave the clarification at a meeting with young Christian leaders on Wednesday in Lagos.Osinbajo dismissed the purported resignation being circulated on some social media platforms and described it as deliberate propaganda.“They are deliberate propaganda. Today (Wednesday), they’ve been spreading some information around that I have resigned.“They said I didn’t attend a security meeting yesterday. I was too busy in my office.“The same security people were meeting with me that same evening. Must I attend every meeting? Can’t the President hold a meeting with the security chiefs without me?“They said I was so angry that they didn’t bring me to that meeting, that I was excluded, then I resigned! I have not resigned,” he said.In continuation of the Next Level engagements, Osinbajo visited Ikeja, Lagos State, where he met with the Hausa community.He then proceeded to Yola, Adamawa, where he met a group of Christian leaders.On his return to Lagos on Wednesday, the vice president held an interactive session with young Christian leaders at Muson Center, Onikan, where he cleared the aire on the fake news.Osinbajo is expected in Kwara and Abia States today in continuation of the Next Level engagements.
