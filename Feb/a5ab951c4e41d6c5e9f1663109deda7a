 The Presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN)   and a former Minister of   Education, Dr Obiageli Ezekwesili, who had earlier announced her withdrawal  from the 2019 presidential race, citing lack of support for her vision by the  party leadership polled a total of 7, 223 votes despite her withdrawal. INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, while announcing the results
early on Wednesday in Abuja said Buhari of the All Progressives Congress
(APC) polled 15,191,847 votes to defeat his main challenger, Alhaji
Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) who scored
11,255,978 votes. The ACPN leadership headed by Alhaji Abdul-Ganiyu Galadima  immediately refuted Ezekwesili’s claims, saying that the former minister  was rather pursuing a personal agenda and was never serious about her  ambition. INEC had also said Ezewkwesili’s withdrawal had come too late and
that it was not possible for the commission to substitute her name on
the presidential list. In spite of that, Ezekwesili did not reverse her decision as she suspended all her campaign activities. A total of 73 candidates contested the 2019 presidential election which held on Saturday, Feb. 23, 2019. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
