The acting Director, Army Public Relations, Col. Sagir Musa, assumed duty on Thursday at the Army Headquarters in Abuja.

Sani Usman on Feb. 7, after putting 35 years of service. Col. Aliyu Yusuf, the Chief of Staff in the Directorate of Army Public Relations, who acted in the interim, handed over to Musa. Until his appointment, Musa was the Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, 82 Division, Enugu. Musa pledged to evolve measures, potent ways and means that would improve and strengthen civil/military relationship. He also pledged to improve media relations to win the war against terrorism and other forms of criminality. He said that the directorate had over time developed strategies in managing, defending and projecting the image and reputation of the army “in spite of challenges by the social media.” The new spokesman called for continued partnership between the army and media, devoid of rancor and distrust, adding that the media must assist to tackle security challenges. Dignitaries at the assumption of duty included the National President of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Mr Chris Isiguzo and the President, Nigeria Institute of Public Relations (NIPR), Alhaji Mukhtar Zubairu.
