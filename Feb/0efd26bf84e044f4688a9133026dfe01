The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) on Thursday
warned international observers to desist from inciting comments
concerning the just-concluded Presidential Elections. President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was
declared re-elected by INEC on Wednesday, having polled 15,191,847
votes, winning in 19 states. Buhari defeated other 72 candidates, including Atiku Abubakar, the
candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who scored 11, 255,978
votes and won 17 states and the FCT, to occupy the second position. The Public Relations Officer of the association, Mr Bestman Okereafor, gave the warning in a statement in Enugu. “NANS wishes to specially send a strong note of warning to the
international observers to kindly desist from comments about the
elections that can bring about war in our beloved country Nigeria. “The outcome of the election is a clear signal that Nigerians have spoken with their votes. “As such, NANS is imploring aggrieved parties and contestants to seek redress in the court of law,’’ Okereafor said. According to him, NANS is also giving kudos to the security agents
for conducting themselves in a civil and professional manner during the
discharge of their duties in the entire electoral process. “Even though we have some few reports of violence in some parts of
the country, but the general conduct of security operatives have been a
non-bias one,’’ he said. He, however, once more congratulated President Buhari on his deserved victory at the poll.
