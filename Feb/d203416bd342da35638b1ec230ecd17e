Noble Youths Mass Support Association (NYMSA) a non-governmental organisation, has commended the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the Federal Government for resolving issues that led to the three-month old strike. Mr Godwin Omonya, the National Coordinator of the group, gave the commendation in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Gwagwalada, on Friday.He said the suspension of the strike was a step in the right direction and called for a lasting solution to the issues of incessant strike actions in higher institutions in the country.NAN recalls that ASUU had embarked on an indefinite strike on Nov. 4, 2018, following government’s failure to implement the agreement reached with the union in November 2016.“We commend this positive gesture by the Federal Government and ASUU for calling off the three-month old industrial action.“It clearly shows that ASUU and the government will also find a lasting solution to the issues of incessant strike actions in higher institutions.“That is the beauty and power of dialogue; it also means for ASUU to have suspended the strike, it has the students at heart.“Both sides have also given the strike a human face in view of the hardship it has had on students in the country,” he said.Omonya applauded ASUU and the Federal Government for showing sense of responsibility for the sake of Nigerian students.NAN also reports that ASUU and government representatives spent many hours on Thursday to reach consensus on issues that led to the strike.
