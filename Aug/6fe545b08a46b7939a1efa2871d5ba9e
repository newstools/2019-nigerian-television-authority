The Thai government on Friday launched additional rain-making  operations in the Northern, North-Eastern and Central regions to tackle  serious droughts. According to the Director-General of Department of Rain-making and
Agricultural Aviation (DRAA), Surasee Kittimonthon, six aircraft from
the Air Force and Army division joined the Department’s fleet in
carrying out the cloud-seeding operations in the air. Kittimonthon said the cloud-seeding operations will carry out its
artificial rain duties until the end of September, to fight worst
drought in many years. “Though the drought has slightly eased in some areas due to monsoon
rains in the past several days, almost 200 reservoirs, including 19
major reservoirs, are running very low and are in urgent need of
replenishment. “By means of artificial rain-making so that there will be sufficient
water for consumption to last through the current and following
seasons,“Surasee said. He also said all 11 rain-making units around the country would fly
missions whenever the climate was right, because the window of
opportunity was limited as the wet season would soon be over. The Thai cabinet last month approved a 30 million baht (or 971,310
U.S. dollars) fund for the mission to ease drought in the three regions. NAN reports that on Aug. 1, the the department of Rain-making and
Agricultural Aviation, launched the cloud-seeding efforts to help
generate much-needed rain for drought areas in the central-north and
north-east regions of the country. Some areas need urgent rains to replenish the region’s eight major  and 11 medium-sized reservoirs, where water levels have dropped  drastically and sit at historic lows for this time of the year.
