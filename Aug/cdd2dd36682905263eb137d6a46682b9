The Lamido of Adamawa, Alhaji Muhammadu Barkindo, has cautioned past  and present leaders to refrain from hate speeches capable of destroying  the country. Barkindo made the call in his Eid-el-Kabir Sallah message on Sunday in Yola. The monarch observed that the way and manner some past, present and
religious leaders in the country speak carelessly had become issue of
concern. “Hate speech in the country has reached its peak and the sad aspect
of it is that it’s coming from past, present and religious leaders, who
have responsibility of bringing people together harmoniously. “We have to wake up and stop this dangerous act. Because the Rwanda
and Burundi cases are still fresh in our memory,” barkindo warned. The royal father expressed concern over rampant cases of kidnapping,
incessant killings of innocent citizens and increasing rate of drug
abuse especially among youths. He said reports reaching his palace confirmed that even married women were now involved in drug abuse. “I call on governments to support the National Drugs Law Enforcement
Agency (NDLEA) with modern equipment to enable it fight against the
menace effectively . “I also directed my District and Village Heads to collaborate with
the agency in reporting any drug abuse and suspicious activities to
tackle the situation,” Barkindo added. On the federal government’s ban on sale of raw fertilisers especially
Urea and NPK 15-15 in the state and North East in general for security
reasons, the first class traditional ruler advised farmers not to
abandon agriculture. He however advised urged the farmers to use organic fertiliser and other alternative inputs on their farms for higher yields.
