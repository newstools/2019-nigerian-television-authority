Bishop Paulinus Ezeokafor of the Catholic Diocese of Awka  has called  on Christians to remain truly faithful to their faith  and shun  neo-paganism which he described as the love for earthly things. Ezeokafor gave the charge in his homily at Christ The King Catholic Parish, Isuaniocha near Awka, the Anambra capital on Sunday. He said Christians, who pay attention to earthly possessions such as
wealth, beauty, intelligence, spouses, children, jewellery, cars, houses
and others  had already relegated God to the background. ” Holding different public positions or serving in different
capacities in Church without living a Christ-like life is a waste of
time which will not take you anywhere. “Think more about your spiritual life, eternity and how to serve God
and mankind with that position,” the cleric admonished the faithful. Ezeokafor also advised  Christians to be vigilant and be ready to
fight in defense of their faith as well as show humility as the biblical
John the Baptist and Jesus Christ did. In his remarks, the  Priest of Christ The King Parish, Rev. Fr.
Kenneth Ekwealili, commended the bishop for making out time to visit
them. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Ezeokafor during the
Mass administered the Sacrament of Confirmation on 510 faithful as well
as dedicated the  Holy Trinity Chapel facility. NAN also  reports that that Sacrament of Confirmation is the 
Catholic Church’s belief in  the special outpouring of the Holy Spirit
on her faithful  for increased ability to practise the  faith and to
witness Christ in every situation. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
