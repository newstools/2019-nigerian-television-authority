International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS in West Africa  (ICWWA) has advocated for rights of women living with the virus in the  region. President of the community, Astou Diop, made the group’s position known  in a statement in Abuja on Friday. Diop stated that a meaningful engagement of women and adolescent
girls living with HIV in planning, implementation and monitoring of
programmes toward checking the spread of the scourge would guarantee
women’s right to health. She urged governments at all levels in West Africa to fulfill the
highest attainable standard of health for all citizens, especially women
living with HIV. She noted that governments should ensure that women were consulted to
make informed decisions and choice of preference with respect to Anti
Retroviral (ARV) regimen. She added that “governments should also ensure that all HIV/AIDS and
sexual and reproductive health services are free, accessible and respect
the rights and dignity of people living with the virus, especially and
key population.” The community leader also called for domestic funding of HIV/AIDS
treatment and services “to accelerate the implementation of West and
Central Africa’s 90-90-90 target.” Diop noted that political leadership, dwindling funding for HIV and
AIDS, the lack of patient centred care, respect for human rights were
responsible for the region’s backwardness in the fight against AIDS. She called for strengthened partnership of Joint UN Programmes on  HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), World Health Organisation (WHO) and Nigeria’s  Ministry of Health to support the leadership capacity of Community board  members.
