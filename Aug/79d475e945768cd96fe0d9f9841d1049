There seems to be breakthrough in the search of alleged Taraba state  kidnap kingpin, Hamisu Bala popularly known as Wadume, following his  re-arrest on Tuesday by the Nigerian police. Reports say he has been taken to the Police Headquarters in Abuja, popularly known as Louis Edet House. Police authorities are yet to respond to inquiries on the matter but
there are indications that police may issue official statement in the
next few hours on the breakthrough. Wadumeâ€™s escape after an attack on his police captors by soldiers and
a village mob along Ibi-Wukari road in Taraba state on Aug. 6 sparked
off massive public reactions and led to the constitution of a special
investigative panel. The investigation panel, which is working with presidential
authority, was initially scheduled to conclude its findings last week
but was given two additional weeks. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
