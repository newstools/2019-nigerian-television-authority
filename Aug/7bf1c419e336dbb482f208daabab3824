The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Lagos Zonal office, has arrested a 32-year-old suspected fraudster, Loretta Okonkwo, for obtaining money under false pretence. Okonkwo, a graduate of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, was arrested on July 19, 2019, in Lagos, following a petition received by the Commission about her fraudulent activities. The complainant alleged that he invested in Recharge and Make Money Limited, a company belonging to the suspect. The petitioner further alleged that the suspect, however, reneged on her promise to offer him a percentage of the proceeds on his investment and also refused to refund him. The suspect will soon be arraigned in court. EFCC Tanimu is an Online Editor with Africa's Largest TV Network. Produces when not on Social media.
