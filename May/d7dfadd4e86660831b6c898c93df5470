Assistant Comptroller of Immigration, FCT Command, Mr Toni
Akuneme, has commended the Comptroller-General Nigeria Immigration Service
(NIS), Mr Muhammad Babandede, for transforming the service in the last three
years.Akuneme paid the tribute in a statement in Abuja to mark Babandede’s
three years in office. Babandede, who was appointed by President Muhammadu
Buhari in May 2016, replaced Mr Martin Abeshi. Akuneme said that the
comptroller-general had “come into the saddle, quite prepared for the task
ahead of him.“Little wonder he hit the ground running upon his appointment
three years ago as the head of Africa’s largest Immigration Corps. “Majority,
if not all officers, are unanimous to commend his aggressive transformation of
the service in terms of infrastructure.”He said that the NIS boss had virtually
converted every available space into a solid edifice.“His effort had given rise
to facilities like conference center, Passport Office annex Store Annex, Multi-Purpose
Cooperative Unit, Fire Service Station, Petrol Station and the intimidating
Technology Village being built by the construction giants, Julius Berger. ”Other
achievements, Akuneme said, included the commissioning of permanent offices for
over a dozen state commands of the NIS.
