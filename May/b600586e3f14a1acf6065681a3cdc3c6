Groups under the aegis of ‘Body of Bauchi Lawyers of Conscience’
(BOBALAC) and ‘Bauchi Assembly of Youths Political Actors’ (BAYOPA) in
Bauchi state, have mobilised Islamic scholars to offer special prayers
for peace to reign in the state. It would recalled that Gov. Muhammed Abubakar had on Friday, imposed  curfew on Gudum Fulani, Gudum Hausawa, Gudum Sayawa and Bigi communities  of Bauchi local government area,following a misunderstanding among  youth in the areas that led to breach of the peace and death of three  persons. Speaking on behalf of the groups on Monday, Malam Jibrin Sa’id, said
the measure was aimed at ensuring the sustenance of peace in the state. The groups then  called on the security agencies in the state to
remain vigilant and live up to their responsibilities, adding that all
hands must be on deck to ensure that there was no breach of the peace. “We call on security personnel to be exceptionally vigilant, professional and focused. “It is only by doing so that members of the public can have confidence in them and their efforts in the provision of security. “The people of Bauchi state deserve the best security attention from all the security agencies”, he  said. The groups also urged the people of the state to continue to be law-abiding in all their activities.
