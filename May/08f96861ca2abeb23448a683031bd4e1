The Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Dr Maikanti Baru, has told
workers of the company to support the management in its efforts to
ensure safety and security of workers. Baru gave the charge while speaking at the inauguration of the NNPC  Towers Electronic Gate Access and Visitors Management System in Abuja on  Wednesday. He said that safety and security of the workers were critical in the
determination of the management to re-position the corporation. “Security remained the number one consideration in the list of
priorities as captured in the 12 Business Focus Areas blueprint of the
NNPC management. “The activation of the digital access management system will not only
ensure that the NNPC staff and visitors remained protected within the
precinct of the expansive NNPC Towers, but also help to account for the
massive human traffic.’’ The managing director thanked the project team for seeing to the completion of the project after initial hitches. He noted that the target was to ensure that the system did not only
work, but also upgraded from time to time to meet the best standards in
the world. The NNPC Towers Electronic Gate Access and Visitors Management System
is an integrated management system, encompassing the use of multiple
surveillance cameras positioned within and around the four-tower edifice
of its corporate headquarters. The system also includes scores of multi-dimensional patrol cameras covering the entire precinct and adjoining neighborhood. The system is complete with a digital control room which provides for
real time monitoring of movements across all the 13 floors in the
four-towers, including the basements, car parks and neighborhood.
