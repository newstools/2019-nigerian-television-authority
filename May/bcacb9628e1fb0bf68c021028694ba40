The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are pleased to announce they have
named their first born child: Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor,” the
couple announced on their Instagram account. The couple gave the
world the first glimpse of their “dream” newborn boy on Wednesday — but
kept people guessing on what his name will be. Harry, 34, and
Meghan, 37, emerged in front of the cameras inside Windsor Castle to
show off their son born on Monday, ahead of introducing him to
great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II. “He’s just been a dream,”
said a smiling Meghan, in her first public comments since giving birth
to the seven-pound, three-ounce (3.26-kilogram) baby, who stayed firmly
asleep during his public unveiling. “He has the sweetest
temperament. He’s really calm,” added the Duchess of Sussex, as Prince
Harry cradled the newborn, wrapped in a white blanket, by her side. Royal
watchers have been desperate for a glimpse of the new baby, who is
seventh in the line to the British throne, ever since the couple
announced his birth to their 6.5 million followers on Instagram with the
message “It’s a BOY!” But they disappointed those keen to know what they will call him, with neither new parent mentioning a name on Wednesday. Instead, Harry focused his comments on life as a proud dad. “Parenting  is amazing,” he said, the day after brother Prince William — two years  his senior and with three children of his own — had jokingly welcomed  him to the “sleep deprivation society that is parenting”. “We’re just so thrilled to have our own little bundle of joy.” Meghan added: “It’s been a special couple of days.”
