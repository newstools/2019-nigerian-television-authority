Dr Mohammed Lawan-Gana, Executive Secretary, Yobe Primary Healthcare
Management Board, said on Monday that the state government in
collaboration with a group. Malaria Consortium, would distribute 2.3
million mosquito nets to fight malaria across the state. Lawan-Gana disclosed this in Damaturu at an orientation session with
the media on Long-Lasting Insecticidal Net (LLIN) campaign in the state. The Secretary, who was represented by Mohammed Ali, Director Disease  Control of the board, said the nets were increased from 1.5 million in  2011 to 2.3 million in 2019, to ensure every household was covered. “We feel it is very important to partner the media to mobilise the
public to collect the mosquito nets, and to sensitise the public on how
to use the nets. “Although malaria is an all-year round affair, but we are putting
more efforts before the commencement of the rainy season, which is
always the peak of malaria,” he said. Mrs Adaeze Adenagbon, Senior Campaign Manager, Malaria Consortium,
said that 956 distribution points had been identified across the state. “The distribution points are within the communities and very
accessible so that beneficiaries do not have to incur additional cost to
access the mosquito nets. “The programme will engage 800 mobilisers, to ensure everyone benefits from the distribution,” she said.
