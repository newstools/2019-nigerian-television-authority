Nigeria’s Super Falcons have qualified for the final of the WAFU Women’s Cup in Abidjan, Cote D’Ivore. The Nigeria national women team, the Super Falcons are now through to
the final of the ongoing WAFU Cup tournament in Abidjan after they beat
Ghana’s Black Queens 4-2 on penalties on Thursday. The two arch-rivals battled to a barren draw in regulation time of
the keenly-contested semi-final contest at the Stade Robert Champroux
before the Falcons emerged victorious in the ensuing penalty kicks. Thursday’s result was sweet revenge for the Super Falcons who lost on penalties to Ghana at the same stage last year. While there will be no title defence for the Queens, the Super
Falcons, who are gearing up for the World Cup in France would be hoping
to win the sub-regional tournament having only claimed the third spot in
the last edition. Before conquering Ghana in the semi-final, the Nigeria women’s team
bashed their counterparts from Burkina Faso 5-1, defeated Mali 2-0,
while also recording a 15-0 annihilation of the dames from the Niger
Republic. The Nigerians will face host, Cote d’Ivoire, on Sunday in the final of the 2019 WAFU Women Cup.
