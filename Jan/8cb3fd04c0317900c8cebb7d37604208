By Raphael Enwelu President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to Anambra has been described as a positive inclusion of the people into the Nigerian project. The News Agency reports on Thursday in Onitsha that most of the people interview over the visit expressed gratitude for what Buhari has done so far for the state and hoped for more in his second tenure. Mr Sunday Ofili, a businessman said that it is a fact to say that our president has the whole nation at heart. “We all know the number of votes Mr President got from this region and this state in particular, yet he completed some projects that have been lingering for long. “Nnamdi Azikiwe resting place was completed by him without campaigning over it which is a good one from him,” he said. Mrs Nkechi Nwoye, a civil servant said that with what she knows of Mr President, he is a prudent administrator. “Our president will do better than what he has done so far in this his first tenure because of the mess he found us in. “I am happy for the way and manner he is running the country’s affairs without blemish, only the issue of herdsmen and farmers clash and insurgency from the North east that he should tackle with vigour,” she said. Mr Ikechukwu Obike, a trader on his part praised the President for his stand on the importation ban of goods that can be produced here. “Imagine our President banned the importation of rice to the country, today there is competition among states for rice production which is making our economy to grow. “Buhari is actually a true Nigerian that has the interest of serving the nation since he was young. Let’s all support him,” he said.
