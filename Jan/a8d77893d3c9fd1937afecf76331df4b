 The founder, Faith Revival Apostolic Church (FRAC), Apostle Paul Adenuga, has described the stealing of female pants to make quick money as very shameful. Adenuga condemned the act at the Christian Press of Nigeria (CPAN) breakfast meeting held in Lagos on Sunday. “You can imagine, some men go to steal women pants because they want to make sudden money and some of these men are caught and displayed on social media, what a shame,” he said. According to Adenuga, one of the factors that has intensified such evil acts is that many churches have deviated from preaching the true message of the gospel. The Apostle posited that many churches preached more about how to make  money and neglected the real gospel message that has moral instructions to help cultivate good virtues in Nigerian youths. He, therefore, urged parents especially mothers, to intensify prayers for their wards not to be involved in the shameful acts.
