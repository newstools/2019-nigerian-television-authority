Mr Ahmed Abba, Director of National Orientation Agency (NOA) in
Adamawa has expressed concern over the use of  hate speeches and verbal
attacks by some politicians using radio stations in the state. Speaking during a sensitization campaign on Friday in Yola, the
director said Nigerians owed it a duty to ensure that the forthcoming
general elections were concluded without any rancour. He however said there was significant reduction in political violence during campaigns and rallies in the state. Abba said that the aims of the sensitisation campaign was to educate
people, especially rural communities, on how to vote properly and avoid
unnecessary mistakes. He recalled that during past elections, the state recorded
substantial number of invalid votes, hence the need to educate the
people. ” The aim of the sensitisation is to reach out to about 1.9 million
eligible voters and educate them on the process and how to vote properly
to avoid past mistakes,” Abba said. He said that the agency  had flagged-off the sensitisation campaign in all the 21 local government areas in the state. On how the elderly, sick and disable people would cast their votes, he said INEC had made special arrangement for them.
