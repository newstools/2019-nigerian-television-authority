Alhaji Musa Amshi, Executive Chairman, Bureau for Public Procurement and
Fiscal Responsibility Board, Yobe, on Tuesday, said the state
government had achieved 90 per cent implementation of Open Government
Partnership (OGP). Amshi stated this in Damaturu while receiving OGP delegates who paid him a courtesy visit in his office. According to him, government has practically implemented 80 to 90 per
cent OGP and has been transparent and accountable in its activities and
decisions putting in place adequate mechanisms to justify its
administrative actions. “What remains now is an official implementation as the state government
has already established Bureau for Public Procurement and Fiscal
Responsibility Board,” he said. The OGP Co-Chairman, Rajab Muhammed, said that the partnership had
brought together government reformers and civil society organisation
leaders to create action plans that make governments more inclusive,
responsive and accountable. Muhammed said that in the spirit of multi-stakeholder collaboration, OGP
was overseen by a steering committee, including representatives of
governments and civil society organisations. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that OGP was formally launched
in September 2011for governments to become sustainable, transparent,
accountable, and more responsive to their own citizens.
