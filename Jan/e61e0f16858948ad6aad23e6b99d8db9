Gov. Ibrahim Gaidam of Yobe on Wednesday advised military personnel in the state to stay away from partisan politics and the electioneering process. Gaidam gave the advice at the zonal rally of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Sabon Gari, Nangere Local Government Area of the state. He said that a report had been made on the alleged involvement of some military personnel in partisan politics to the military authorities. He warned that the party would not watch a repeat of what happened in 2015 when some military men aided politicians to rig election. “I have already reported the matter and I will personally meet the Chief of Army staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai on the matter to avoid a repeat of the past,” he said. The governor urged the people to vote for APC candidates, assuring that their votes would count. “I want to assure you that your vote for APC will ensure continuity of the development programmes of the party,” he said. Alhaji Maimala Buni, the APC governorship candidate in the state, pledged to sustain the policy of accountability and good governance initiated by the Gaidam administration. “We should vote for APC Presidential, governorship, national candidates and state legislators for unity of purpose and infrastructure development,” he said.
