President Buhari commiserates with family, friends and Hadejiya community members of the former governor, who also served the country as Minister of Works and Housing, and Minister of Federal Capital Territory. The President believes the sacrifices and good-heartedness of the former governor will always be remembered, most remarkably in revitalizing the Expanded Programme of Immunization for women and children in Kano and working assiduously to ensure successful movement of the nationâ€™s capital city from Lagos to Abuja. As a military officer, the President affirms that Abdullahi was disciplined, focused and fully committed to the unity and progress of Nigeria. President Buhari prays that God will comfort his family and grant him eternal rest. Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa.
