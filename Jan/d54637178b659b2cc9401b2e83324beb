The decision by the assembly followed a motion of urgent public importance presented before it by a member representing Dala Constituency, Alhaji Babangida Alhassan. According to him, foreign traders who are selling goods to the local traders in Kano as whole sales have now embarked started operating as retailers. He, therefore, said that such act was capable of denying the local traders in the state their daily earnings, which according to him, necessitates urgent measures to be taken. The legislator said, “It is unfortunate that foreign traders who were known to bring goods to our local traders and sell to them as whole sales, are now taking over the retail sales business. “Those foreign traders have not only taken the retail trading in our markets, but have engaged in selling products to our traders at a particular amount, and also sell it to consumers below that. Our traders normally travel to their country to buy the goods, especially clothing materials, but they stopped them and now the foreigners have chosen to open shops in our markets and sell at retail rates.” According to Alhassan, if the foreigners are allowed to continue to open shops to sell the products on retail, it is an attempt to take over the business from the local traders. After contributions by the legislators, the assembly unanimously set up the ad hoc committee under the leadership of the assembly’s Deputy Chief Whip, Alhaji Ayuba Labaran to investigate the issue.
