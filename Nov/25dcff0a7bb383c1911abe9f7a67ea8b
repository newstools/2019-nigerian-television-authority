This is major fallout of the 8th National Council on Lands, Housing and Urban development, to enable workers own houses and live above the poverty line. Researchers identify shelter as next only to food and clothing in the hierarchy of human needs. Yet, house rent is said to consume up to 60% of the income of average Nigerian workers, a recipe for hard life. This is the 8th national council on lands, housing and urban development. It is a convergence of like minds. Most states of the federation are represented. Private developers are not left out.

The chief implementer is in a hurry. He breaks it down, even further.   And then, the legislature promises the needed support to smoothen the process.

work together, only time will tell. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
