Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Thursday at the Presidential Villa,
Abuja, received a delegation of Chinese entrepreneurs led by billionaire
businessman and co-founder of Alibaba Group, Jack Ma. Alibaba Group Holding Limited is a Chinese multinational company with
investments in e-commerce, retail, Internet, and technology. Osinbajo and Ma, during their interaction, spoke on opportunities in Nigeria’s digital economy and huge population. The vice president  thanked Ma for honouring the invitation he
extended to him to visit Nigeria when they met at the World Economic
Forum in Davos. According to Osinbajo, Nigeria represents incredible opportunity and
potential as it will, in another two decades, become the third largest
in terms of population in the entire world. Osinbajo said that the Alibaba group had achieved a lot in terms of
broadening the scope of business and activities for people everywhere. “If there is anything you have achieved, for the politician, we say you have democratised business. “It is a great achievement and I think it is something we will like
to learn from and benefit from ,especially as we open up government
businesses and transactions and make them more efficient for the use of
our people. “This is an exciting time for us and we are very happy that you are
here and a lot of businesses and entrepreneurs are looking forward to
your interacting with them later today. “I think you will find a very energetic, very creative group of young
men and women and old men and women who are increasingly getting
interested in entrepreneurship ,especially digital entrepreneurship and I
am happy to see that you have a good group of businesses from China. “ I hope it will create an opportunity to start investigating
business opportunities in Nigeria and I really hope that we will be able
to do something and create some opportunities here.’,he said. The vice president said that Nigeria had a lot entrepreneurs and young people who were actively engaged in the digital economy. He said that the Federal Government started a job programme for young
people called N-Power ,where half a million young people were engaged. He said that the government had to build the e-infrastructure to make the programme happen. Osinbajo said that a system was developed in which N-Power
beneficiaries were paid online and online materials were put  in open
and accessible portals for them. “They also have equipment which enables them to train as extension
workers for farm; we train them to teach also using the open portal; and
it has proved to tremendously successful. “We have a programme called broadband connectivity for all by 2023;
which basically is to see how we can deepen connectivity across the
country by 2023 and we are looking just as you said about e-government. “That is also crucial because government tend to be viewed with a
great deal of suspicion; nobody is quite sure of what government is up
to all the time. “ I think that the government can benefit from the efficiency that digital economy provides,’’ he said. Earlier in his remark, Ma said that Chinese entrepreneurs were bringing four `Es’ to Africa. He said that the first `e’ was e-infrastructure; to support internet
connection to all parts of Africa as it hoped that every young people,
every small business should have a mobile phone  to run their businesses
anywhere, anytime. “We hope to support e-entrepreneurs; we want to make entrepreneurs
the heroes of the African continent, it is the entrepreneurs that
promote business development in China; government support entrepreneur
with the infrastructure they need. “If the government is on `e’, government will be very efficient,
transparent and the people know what the government can do and the
government know what the people want. “The last and very important is e-education; in the next few days, we
are going to have African e-entrepreneur prize; so all the African
countries can apply for our awards. “ So, I am very happy to hear that four Nigerian entrepreneurs are
right among the top 10;  we will be in the final competition in two days
and I think Nigerian entrepreneurs will have a great result. “It is just the beginning for us; our job is to support   entrepreneurs because we are all entrepreneurs; we are all founders of  our own businesses in China,’’ he said.
