Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Delta Governor, Senator (Dr.)  Ifeanyi Okowa, on Thursday said Micro, Small and Medium Scale  Enterprises (MSMEs) were the fastest ways of growing the economies of  states and the nation. They made their positions known in Asaba at the 25th edition of MSMEs
Clinic organised by the Delta Government in collaboration with Office
of the Vice President. Osinbajo commended Okowa’s administration for its commitment to
growing MSMEs, noting that effort of the state government were in line
with President Muhammadu Buhari’s resolve to make businesses work in
Nigeria. “The Federal Government is determined to create a Nigeria where small
businesses are nurtured and encouraged to thrive and prosper. “Nigeria is an economy driven largely by small businesses and it is
clear that there can be no real national growth and development if we do
not ensure that our small businesses are developed. “If every small business in Nigeria add just one more employee, the
gap that single action will fill in our unemployment figures will be
much larger than if one single conglomerate were to employ 10,000
people. “So, we really believe that the MSMEs are the engine of growth in our
country and we are therefore, fully committed to ensure that as a
government, we will remove all the obstacles that is standing in the way
of the MSMEs so that they can have the opportunity to thrive and grow,”
he said. Osinbajo added that efforts were on to ensure a single-digit interest
rates for MSMEs, emphasising that the clinic afforded the MSME
operators the opportunity to present their challenges to relevant
government agencies. Okowa had in an address, said “MSMEs have been globally recognised as
engines of rapid economic growth, wealth creation, employment
generation and social inclusion. “They are also known as incubators of innovation while providing
opportunities for increased participation of women in the economy. “Defined as enterprises with less than 10 employed persons and annual
turnover of less than N20 million, MSMEs are more feasible and
attractive to the mass of people seeking entrepreneurship,
self-employment, livelihood incomes and economic participation.” He commended the vice president for supporting things that had to do
with Delta, adding that his administration would always identify with
any programme or concept that focused on nurturing, supporting and
promoting the growth of MSMEs. The governor said that across the state, there were testimonies of
successful small businesses and life-changing testimonies by those who
were trained, established and mentored under STEP, YAGEP schemes of the
government and from its vocational training centres. High point of the event was the inspection of YAGEP Cluster farms at
Ibusa by the vice president, who had earlier on arrival at the Event
