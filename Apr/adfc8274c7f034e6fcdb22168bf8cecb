The University of Lagos was founded in 1962. It presently has three Campuses in Yaba and Surulere. Whereas two of its Campuses are located in Yaba (the main campus in Akoka and the recently created campus at the former School of Radiography), its College of Medicine is located in Idi-Araba, Surulere. It is remarkable that all the three campuses are located in the Mainland of Lagos. Its main campus is largely surrounded by the scenic view of the Lagos lagoon on 802 acres of land in Akoka, North Eastern part of Yaba. To fewer than 104 students of the faculties of Arts, Environmental Science, Science, Education and Social Science  bagged first-class degrees from the University of Lagos in Akoka, Lagos State, during the first day of the university’s 50th convocation. They emerged from the  12,811  students who will graduate from the school this year. The Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of UNILAG’s Governing Council, Dr Wale Babalakin, praised  the graduands. He said, “Be leaders in your fields, the bottom is always crowded, so avoid being at the bottom. Your degree is not just to earn a living but also to be able to contribute to changing society for the better.” Giving the  breakdown of the graduands,  UNILAG  Vice-Chancellor, Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe,  said  3,795 students from the five faculties were conferred with first degrees.

Also, at the ceremony, a 77-year-old female retiree bagged a first degree in Guidance and Counselling. The retiree, who insisted on speaking on condition of anonymity, was  among the 1,008 students who graduated from the Faculty of Education. After immense pressure from journalists to speak, she said, “I am most grateful to God who made me see this day as I  have realised my dream. I am very sorry, I won’t mention my  name because I know where I am coming from and what I am protecting.
