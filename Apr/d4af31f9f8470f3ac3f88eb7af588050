alleged SARS operatives. The Senate President said, “My heartfelt  prayers are with the family and friends of Kolade Johnson, the young  football fan who was allegedly killed by men of the Nigerian Police in  Mangoro/Onipetesi community in Lagos. “Issues like the senseless killings, assault, and extortion of  everyday Nigerians by some ‘bad apples’ in the Police Force is what  prompted @NGRSenate to introduce and fast-track the progression of the  #PoliceReformBill. “I have also been in contact with the Chairman  of the Senate Committee on Police Affairs and I am pleased to announce  that the Report of the #PoliceReformBill will be laid by next week  Tuesday. “Make no mistake, the 8th Senate remains committed to the  passage of the #PoliceReformBill to ensure that our Police Force is  more efficient and responsive to the needs of all Nigerians.”
