The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) says the Air Task Force (ATF) of  Operation LAFIYA DOLE has neutralised some Islamic State of West Africa  Province (ISWAP) terrorists at Tumbun ‘Alpha’, in Northern Borno. NAF’s Spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, who disclosed this
in a statement on Saturday in Abuja, said the operation was conducted on
Friday. He said Tumbun Alpha is a small settlement about 4km West of Tumbun
Allura, on the fringes of Lake Chad in the Northern part of Borno. Daramola explained that the air strikes were conducted on the heels
of credible intelligence reports indicating that some ISWAP leaders and
members had assembled for a meeting under a group of trees near a
prominent makeshift structure within the settlement. “A Nigerian Air Force (NAF) platform dispatched for Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) confirmed the presence of several
ISWAP fighters within the vicinity of the target. “Accordingly, the ATF scrambled a NAF Alpha Jet to attack the location. “The bombs from the aircraft recorded hits on the target area
resulting in significant damage to surrounding structures with a large
fire observed and several of the terrorists neutralised,” he said. The spokesman said the NAF, operating in concert with surface forces,
would sustain its operations against the terrorists in the North East. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
