President Muhammadu Buhari has departed Amman Jordan for Dubai, to begin the second leg of his Middle East visit. In Jordan, he attended the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa, where he spoke on the vast investment opportunities in Nigeria and x-rayed the Boko Haram rebellion in the North east as a manifestation of lack of economic and social inclusion. Buhari told WEF that his administration is determined to industrialise Nigeria, leveraging on the nationâ€™s comparative advantage and recognising the private sector as the agent of growth. He described the Middle East as a natural partner in the development agenda, urging African and the Middle East countries to focus on policies that would deliver shared economic prosperity for their citizens.
