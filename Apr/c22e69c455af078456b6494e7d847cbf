Immediate past Governor of Ekiti state, Ayodele Fayose has reacted to Nyesom Wike’s re-election for a second term as Governor of Rivers State. Fayose in a post on his Twitter page described Wike’s victory as a historic one. Mocking the opposition, Fayose said Wike’s victory showed that Nigerians were capable of defeating ‘tyranny’ threatening democracy. The former governor wrote: “I congratulate my friend and brother, Governor Ezenwo Nyesom Wike and the entire people of Rivers state for this sweet and historic victory over those forces of evil who for their own selfish reasons turned the state to a killing field. “That the people of Rivers State stood by Governor Wike and the PDP even in the face of death is a sign that Nigerians are capable of defeating tyranny and this will just be the beginning of more victories over the forces threatening the survival of democracy in our country.” News Agency reports that Governor Nyesom Wike of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, was on Wednesday declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC . The State Returning Officer, Deputy Vice Chancellor of Federal University, Otuoke, Bayelsa State, Professor Teddy Addia, declared that Governor Wike polled 886,264 votes to defeat his closest rival Biokpomabo Awara of the AAC who polled one hundred and seventy three thousand, eight hundred and nine votes.
