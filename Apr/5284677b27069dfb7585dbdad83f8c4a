The death toll of Easter Sunday attacks on Churches and hotels in Sri Lanka rose to 290, the police said this on  Monday. About 500 people had also been reported wounded in the attacks. The Sri Lankan police said it has arrested 24 people in connection with a  series of devastating suicide bombings attack in the country. According to The New York Times webiste, The government on Monday blamed National Thowheeth Jama’ath,  a little-known radical Islamic terror organization, for the attacks.  More than two weeks ago, a police official warned of a threat on  churches by the group, but the authorities failed to act on the  information. “A forensic analysis of body parts found at six sites determined that seven suicide bombers conducted attacks at three  churches and three hotels, according to The Associated Press. Most  attacks were carried out by a single bomber, but two men targeted the  Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo. Two other bombings at a guesthouse and the  suspects’ safe house remain under investigation.” The New York Times said. The government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew for a second night on Monday in the country’s capital, Colombo. Major social media platforms and messaging services have been blocked by the government to curb the spread of misinformation about the attack.
