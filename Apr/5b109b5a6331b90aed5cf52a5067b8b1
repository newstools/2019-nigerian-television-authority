Association of Mobile Communications Device Technicians (AMCODET) on Wednesday said it partnered the Nigeria Police to check incidences of phone theft in the country. The National President of the association, Mr Apara Ige, disclosed
this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. Ige said that the partnership became necessary following the ease at which phones were stolen and AMCODET members arrested for crimes they never committed. He said “we recently got a lot of reports from our members who were arrested wrongly because they unlocked stolen phones. “Due to such unpleasant reports, we approached the police to
introduce a solution called `Mobile Phone Unlocking Clearance Permit’
and Unlocking Acceptance forms. “The form will have to be filled by the customer at the point of
unlocking any phone by an engineer who is our member and presented to
the police in case of any issues. “We have been in series of meetings with the Intelligence Response
Team of the Police to buy into this idea which can reduce phone theft
across the country.” He recognised that the police were doing their job by securing lives
and properties, but it was important the real criminals were indicted
for their crimes. Ige, however, urged the public to comply with the solution and rather
not feel embarrassed when asked questions concerning phones they
present to engineers for unlocking. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
