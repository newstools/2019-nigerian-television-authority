Members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria- the Shiite on Tuesday,  invaded the National Assembly Complex throwing stones and injuring three  police men. The invaders stormed the complex at about 1.30 p.m., demanding the  release of their leader Ibrahim El Zakzaky who has been in detention for  about four years. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that injured police men were rushed to the NASS clinic for treatment. The protesters forced their way through the first gate near the Federal  Secretariat and headed to the main building where they clashed with  security operatives. Some vehiclesâ€™ screens were broken with stones in the process, resulting  in the closure of the second gate by security agents who placed  restriction on movement in and out of the building. NAN also reports that plenary is still going on at the House of Representatives. Additional police men are also being deployed in strategic locations to  forestall total breakdown of law and order in the complex.
