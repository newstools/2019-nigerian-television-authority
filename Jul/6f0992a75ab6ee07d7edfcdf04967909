(NAN) The Yobe State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) will  henceforth coordinate all humanitarian activities to harmonize  interventions by local and international partners. Dr Mohammed Goje, SEMA Executive Secretary, disclosed this at a
meeting with United Nations agencies, international and local
Non-Governmental Organisations, Development partners and donor agencies. Goje said this became necessary to cut unnecessary expenditure,
duplication of activities and to ensure efficient delivery of assistance
and interventions to the target communities and beneficiaries. The Secretary said SEMA as the coordinator of humanitarian agencies
in the state, would encourage monthly meetings and share technical
reports to strengthen partnership for effective service delivery. Goje said SEMA would provide a platform for all humanitarian actors for a coherent and principled response to emergencies. “SEMA will be knocking at your doors, the perceptions that SEMA is
only contacted at the entry point and launching of activities for mere
visibility will no longer be tolerated. “We shall be in constant touch with you at all stages of planning, surveys and implementation and monitoring. “We shall be going to your mission head offices in Abuja periodically and brief them on status of your support to the state. “This administration is determined to pull resources from government
and other sources for a sustainable reconstruction, rehabilitation and
recovery of livelihood of areas affected by insurgency to enhance
sustainable growth and development,” he said. The secretary assured that SEMA would continue to support genuine
partners and bridge all gaps through enhanced coordination and capacity
building. (NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.  I currently serve as I.T Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network NTA
