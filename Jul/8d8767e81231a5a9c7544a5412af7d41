The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) says it has lifted the
ban it placed on 89 filling stations belonging to Petrocam Trading
Nigeria Ltd. for violating the agency’s rules and regulations. Mr Ahmed Shakur, the acting Director of DPR, told newsmen in Lagos on
Monday that the filling stations were reopened following an agreement
between the management of the firm and the agency. Shakur said that since the firm had met the agency’s guidelines for
gas operations in the country, it has no option than to reopen the
filling stations. The acting director, who did not state when the infraction was
committed, said that the agency sealed the filling stations after the
company, on its own, unsealed its gas plant in Ayobo, a suburb in Lagos
State. According to him, the agency on two occasions sealed the gas plant, but the firm on its own broke the government seal. “We immediately sealed the firm’s 89 filling stations nationwide and
ensure that there was no supply of petroleum products to the company. “As at today, the company has complied with the rules of the
department, and they have showed remorse for their actions, hence the
lifting of the ban,” he said. The DPR chief reiterated that the agency has zero tolerance for any act of infraction. He urged the operators to always follow the rules.
