The Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), says it has  concluded arrangements to deploy additional 1, 500 personnel under its  Agro-Ranger scheme to farmlands this cropping season to provide security  for farmers. The Commandant-General of the corps, Mr Abdullahi Muhammadu made this
known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in
Maiduguri on Saturday. According to Muhammadu, the measure is to protect farmers against
incessant attacks by bandits and kidnappers to enable them cultivate
their farmlands. He said that the deployment would also mobilise farmers and build
their confidence to enable them carry out their activities without fear. Muhammadu explained that about 750 personnel would undergo five-week
training before deployment to the eight bandits’ prone areas in Katsina
State. He said that the personnel would be exposed to techniques
for internal security, map reading, tactics, first aid and field craft
as well as Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detection and
demobilisation. The commander decried reports which indicated that several farmers
were killed in farmlands, while others had been displaced due to attacks
by the bandits. Muhammadu said that the Agro-Ranger unit was created following
request by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture to provide security to
the proposed 250 cattle ranches in the country. Agro-Ranger scheme was designed to secure ranches animals and grazing areas to encourage investment in agriculture. NAN recalls that the corps had in January deployed about 2, 500 personnel to check clashes between farmers and herdsmen.
