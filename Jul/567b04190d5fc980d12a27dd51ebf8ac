Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena said that all suspects  involved in the Easter Sunday terror explosions had been arrested. He said the arrests were made, following extensive investigations and
search operations carried out by security forces and that the suspects
might receive the death penalty as there was clear evidence against
them, local media reported on Wednesday. Speaking at a function in Malabe on the outskirts of Colombo,
Sirisena said that according to the countryâ€™s criminal law, death
sentence could be given to those found guilty of murder and conspiring
against the state. He said that all suspects involved in the Easter Sunday attacks
should be given death sentence, noting that over 250 people were killed
in the incident. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at the parliament last week
that security forces were continuing search operations and
investigations. (Xinhua/NAN) Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
