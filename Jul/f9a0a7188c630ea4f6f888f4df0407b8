The Borno chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) on
Tuesday in Maiduguri, condemned fresh attacks by Boko Haram insurgents
on communities in Borno, and called for an end to the insurgency. Mr Bulama Talba, Chairman of NUJ in a statement, said the council was
concerned over the unabated attacks by the insurgents against civilians
in Maiduguri, Nganzai, Kaga, Bama and Kukawa Local Government Areas of
the state. Talba said the union would support efforts to end the conflict and restore lasting peace to the region. He urged the security agencies to adopt new strategies to counter the
insurgents activities and called on the people to provide useful
information on the negative activities of the attackers, in order to
protect lives and property. While commending the military for degrading the insurgents mode of
operation, Talba called for more strategy and synergy to safeguard
returnees and displaced persons in resettled communities and Internally
Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps. “The union reassures of professional support and conduct in promoting
quick end to the armed conflict in Borno and Lake Chad region. “We call on the Federal Government to engage more stakeholders and
explore channels of diplomacy, to put a stop to the menace causing one
havoc after another. “We equally call on the insurgents to sheathe their swords, embrace
path of reconciliation and dialogue with the government to end the
decade-long conflict that has inflicted too many pains and loss of
lives,” he added. (NAN) Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa. Iam a graduate of Mass Communication with special interest on social media and Online Editor and a Reporter.
