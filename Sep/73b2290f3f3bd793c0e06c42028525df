The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) on Tuesday confiscated
fake electrical cables and wires worth N3.5million in Osogbo, Osun. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the organisation  confiscated the wires during a raid of  electrical markets in Osogbo. NAN also reports that the regulatory agency sealed some of the  electrical shops after their owners fled on sighting its officials. Mr Jerome Umoru, SON’s s coordinator in Osogbo told newsmen after the
raid  that the exercise  was aimed at sanitising the markets of
 substandard cables and wires. Umoru said that substandard electric cables and wires posed grave
danger of heating up, which could easily lead to fire outbreaks. He said that SON would not relent in its mandate of ensuring that there were quality products in the markets. He said that SON would not relent until it prosecuted electrical
dealers who were determined to flood the markets with substandard
products. Umoru said that SON’s enforcement team would continue to burst
dubious importers and sellers who were dealing in substandard electrical
materials. Umoru, however, warned dealers of electrical cables to desist from
selling the products or risk continued seizure of the products by the
regulatory agency.(NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.  I currently serve as I.T Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network NTA
