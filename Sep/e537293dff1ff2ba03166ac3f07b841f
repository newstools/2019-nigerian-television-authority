The Federal Government has approved 5.3 billion dollars for the  Ibadan-Kano standard gauge rail project, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, the Minister  of Transportation said. The minister disclosed this in a statement issued on Thursday in
Abuja by his media aide, Mr Israel Ibeleme after the 3rd Maritime
Stakeholders Interactive Forum held in Lagos. “Yesterday, we got approval to complete the 5.3billion dollar Ibadan
to Kano rail project and we have also applied for funding to commence
coastal rail for the Port-Harcourt to Warri segment.” Amaechi explained that the minister of Transportation, State,
Gbemisola Saraki, has been assigned the responsibilities of overseeing
all the maritime agencies. He will be focusing on the Railway sector. “In my first term as Minister, I completely abandoned the maritime sector to the Heads of agencies. “This time around that would not be happening again as I have
instructed that the Minister of Transportation for State should
personally supervise the maritime agencies, while I just oversee what is
happening. “There are two things that I have discussed with President Muhammadu
Buhari that I will be focusing on in this second term as a Minister and
they are maritime security and the Single Window project. “I have assured government that by the end of 2020, we should have the Single Window at our maritime sector.” President Muhammadu Buhari directed the establishment of the single
window platform that would integrate all government agencies at all the
entry points into the country to promote trade and boost security.
