President Muhammadu Buhari said he was “devastated’’ by the passing  of his classmate, Dr. Tukur Abdullahi, a Kaduna based medical doctor,  who died at the National Hospital, Abuja. The President made his feelings known in a condolence message by his
Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in
Abuja on Thursday. He said Tukur, who established and operated Jinya Specialist
Hospital, was an “epitome of kindness, warmth and care which he brought
into medical practice’’. He said: “As one of those who schooled with the deceased, I was
always delighted to be associated with the gentleman, who was so nice. “The late Dr Tukur was not only a gentleman, but also a compassionate
and dedicated professional who chose medicine out of his sheer passion
to serve humanity. “I am deeply touched by the demise of Dr Tukur, one of the finest
medical doctors you can ever meet. May Allah bless his gentle soul, and
reward his good deeds with paradise. “May God comfort his family and give them the fortitude to overcome this irreparable loss.’’ President Buhari also condoled with Tukur’s family, Katsina Emirate,
government and people of Katsina over the sad loss, urging them to find
solace in his good works.(NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.
