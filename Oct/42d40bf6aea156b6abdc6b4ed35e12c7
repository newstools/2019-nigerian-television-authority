Uncomfirmed number of terrorists were reportedly wounded during the ambush. There is no casualty on the Nigerian Army or Civilian JTF. Items recovered by troops include 2 X AK 47 rifles and  2 X bicycles. Similarly, at about 2250 hours on 3rd October 2019, in what seems like a repraisal attack to avenge the lost of their members in the ambush conducted by the troops, some marauders/criminals woefully attacked the Delta Company Location of the SRA at Pulka. Consequently,  troops  swiftly responded by effectively repelling the attack, one bandit lost his life and one Ak 47 rifle was recovered. No casualty was recorded by the Civ JTF or the troops. The Acting General Officer Commanding 7 Division and Commander Sector 1 Operation LAFIYA DOLE Brigadier General AK Ibrahim was in SRA Pulka where he interacted with the troops, commended them for the successes so far and urged them to remain committed and unwavering in the struggle to end the insurgency soon.
