Between the 1st and 8th of October 2019, troops of the Nigerian Army operating in various theatres of operations across the country have continued to record significant achievements. During the period under review, troops intensified their operations nationwide to deny criminal elements freedom of action, leading to a safer and more conducive environment especially with the approach of the 2019 festivities. Notable achievements during the period are as follows: In the NE Theatre,  as troops of Operation LAFIYA DOLE intensify the bombardment of identified Boko Haram criminals locations and blockade of the criminals’ crossing points and escape routes, more criminal insurgents are giving up their indignant acts of criminality and surrendering to troops. This sobriety is further exacerbated by hunger resulting from the blockade of their supply routes, the arrest of their Logistics suppliers and collaborators as well as incessant artillery bombardments of their criminal hideouts. Accordingly, 5 marauding Boko Haram criminals surrendered to troops of 3 Battalion in Gamboru Ngala and Dikwa respectively. During preliminary interrogation, the surrendered insurgents revealed that hunger and unending bombardments of their hideouts left them with no choice than to escape from them. They also disclosed that they belong to the Al-Barnawi faction. The surrendered insurgents include Ramat Mohammed, Alhaji Brazil, Bukar Gambo, Waziri Bukar and Bashuna Musa. The suspects are currently undergoing further interrogation. In another development, troops of 115 Task Force Battalion’s Quick Response Group, in conjunction with an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team deployed at Askira, while acting on credible information, mobilized to the area and safely detonated an Improvised Explosive Device planted along Rumirgo – Askira road.
