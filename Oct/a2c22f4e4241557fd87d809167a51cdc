President Muhammadu Buhari congratulates Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on his election victory. The President also felicitates with the Liberal Party of Canada and Canadians generally on the outcome of the Federal election in the country. As a major trading partner, with Nigeria-Canada trade totaling $948.4 million in 2018, President Buhari looks forward to continued relationship with Prime Minister Trudeau  across a wide range of shared values and interests. The President recalls that the visit of Right Honourable Julie Payette, Governor General of Canada, to Nigeria in October 2018, provided an opportunity for Nigeria to appreciate the humanitarian assistance of Canada to civilian populations affected by the Boko Haram insurgency. With the common membership of Nigeria and Canada in the Global Counter Terrorism Forum and several other international organisations, the Nigerian leader trusts that both countries will continue to stand together on issues of peace and security that guarantee a better and more secure world for all.
