The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on Tuesday warned  the public against fraudsters and scammers claiming to have shortlisted  candidates for the recruitment exercise on behalf of the agency. Mr Jonah Achema, Head of Public Affairs, NDLEA, gave the warning in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja.
