In his inauguration speech, he charged the 89 members of the project team drawn from five Key Agencies, to work assiduously whilst embracing the highest level of accountability, to collectively succeed and deliver excellently. Chief Sylva name-checked the leadership that has been consistently provided by the Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari while noting that every organization is as strong as the quality of its leadership. He further expressed his optimism that the gains of the Operation White Project will reduce the inflated product consumption figure and ultimately reduce the subsidy wage bill. In his response, Mallam Kyari encouraged the team members to deliver on the national assignment with a deepened sense of patriotism and excellence. He pledged that the project will monitor and track the entire movement of petroleum products and enshrine visible transparency across the value chain.
