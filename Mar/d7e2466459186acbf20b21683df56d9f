A French policeman shot and killed a fellow officer at police  headquarters in Paris when his service weapon went off while fooling around on Monday. The accident took place on Sunday at the new headquarters of the criminal police in the northwest of the capital. The police source said the officer who fired the shot was playing
with his gun near the entrance to the building when it went off, hitting
his colleague in the head. He has been suspended and taken into custody, judicial and police sources said. A spokesman for the SCPN police union, Jean-Paul Megret, told France
Info radio that the two officers had been practising drawing their
weapons, “either playfully or out of stupidity.” Noting that such exercises were strictly restricted to the shooting
range, he said it was “all the more tragic given that they were just
beginning their careers”. The dead officer, who was in her twenties, was part of a unit that  provided security at the adjacent Palace of Justice, France Info reported. A police oversight body is investigating the shooting. AFP
