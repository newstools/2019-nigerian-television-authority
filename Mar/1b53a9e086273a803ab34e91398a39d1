The Osun state Election Petition Tribunal has declared Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the winner of the 2018 governorship in the state. The 3-man tribunal upheld the petitions filed by Adeleke and the PDP,  challenging the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and  Governor Gboyega Oyetola at the governorship election. A three -member panel of the tribunal , dismissed the  objections filed by Gov. Oyetola, APC and the Independent National  Electoral Commission (INEC). Both Adeleke and the PDP in their different petitions  had urged the tribunal to declared that he scored the highest lawful  votes in the election and should be declared as winner. The PDP Canddidate, Adeleke and party, had filed a petition asking the tribunal to declare  that he polled the highest lawful votes and should be declared the  winner. But Oyetola, APC and INEC had filed their notices of preliminary  objection contending among others that the petition was incompetent and  that the court lacked jurisdiction. The tribunal ruled that the certificate of return issued to Oyetola of the APC be withdrawn and a new one given to Senator Ademola.
