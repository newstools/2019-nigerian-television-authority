than five subjects including English and Mathematics in the recently
released 2018 November/December West African Examination Council (WAEC)
results. Mr Monday Chukwuemeka, the Public Relations Officer of the Nigerian
Prisons Service, Enugu State Command made the disclosure in a statement
issued in Enugu on Tuesday. Chukwuemeka said that the figure released by the Command Desk
Officer, surpassed the feat attained by the students of the prison in
2017 when 110 made credit in the two key subjects. “This is another landmark achievement in educational development of  the NPS inmates in the recently released 2018 WAEC (General Certificate  of Education) November/December results. “The Controller of Prisons, Enugu State Command, Mr Ndubuisi Ogbodo  is overwhelmed with joy hence showered praises on both teachers and  students (inmates) of the centre for putting up a superb performance,’’  he said.

stigmatizing ex convicts as the service had put in place various
programmes to ensure they were adequately reformed. (NAN)
