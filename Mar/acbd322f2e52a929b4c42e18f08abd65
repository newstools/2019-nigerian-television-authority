The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governorship candidate in Kano State, Abba Kabir Yusuf, has expressed confidence that he would emerge winner of the coming governorship re-run election in the state. Kabir-Yusuf, who is the son-in-law of PDP chieftain, Rabui Kwankwaso was leading the state Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje before the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, declared the last Saturday’s election inconclusive. INEC had on Monday declared the state governorship election inconclusive following the allegation of irregularities in Nasarawa Local Government Area of the State. However, Yusuf assured that he would win the re-run despite what he termed enemies of democracy trying to do to truncate the electoral process. In a statement signed by his spokesman, Sanusi Bature Dawakin Tofa, Yusuf said: “The people of Kano have seen glaringly how some enemies of democracy who are ranking officials in Kano State government including the Deputy Governor, Dr. Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, Commissioner for Local Government, Murtala Sule Garo and Chairman of Nassarawa Local Government, Alhaji Lamin Sani vandalised an election collation centre, resulting to truncating the declaration of the result to deny PDP victory.” He also alleged that the PDP was aware of the 500 ballot papers printed by the Kano State Printing Press and syndicated to various polling units across the state, “part of which 10 cartons were intercepted by the police.” “It is our prayer that all election offenders will be charged to court at the earliest time to serve as deterrent to anti-democracy,” he said.
