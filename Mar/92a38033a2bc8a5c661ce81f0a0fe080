The governor said that the inauguration was to formalize the process that started over six months ago of working with a consultant to build 20 Primary Health Care Centres across the state. Obaseki outlined the key functions of the board as to initiate, organize and sponsor programmes for effective healthcare management and manpower development. “Creation of public awareness is of importance to public healthcare in the state,” he charged. He said that the members were also expected to regulate the appointment, promotion, transfer, and discipline of staff of the agencies. Dr. Victor Iyekekpolo, the Chairman of the Board, appreciated the efforts of the governor for repositioning the state healthcare sector. Iyekekpolo, however, urged the governor to expedite action on the proposed amendment to the Edo Primary Health Care Development Board Bill. “It would help provide a legal framework for the successful implementation of Primary Health Care Policies and Programmes in the state,” he said. He commended the governor for considering them worthy to serve as members of the board, pledging that they would not fail in performing their duties effectively and efficiently. (NAN)
