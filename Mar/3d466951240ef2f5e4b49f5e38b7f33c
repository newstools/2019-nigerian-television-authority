The Nigerian army has revealed how its troops engaged a couple of Boko Haram Terrorists in Michika, Adamawa State on Monday night. In a statement to PoliticsNGR signed by Col. Sagir Musa, the acting director of Public Relations, the terrorists were successfully repelled saving dozens of innocent lives. The statement read; “BHTs met their Waterloo and suffered heavy casualties yesterday evening 18 March 2019 when they attempted to infiltrate Michika in Adamawa State.” “At about 7.20 pm, gallant troops of 115 Task Force Battalion deployed at Lassa in Borno State received a distress call from vigilantes at Maikadiri village on movement of suspected BHTs along Road Maikadiri – Shuwari en route Michika. ” “The troops immediately organized blocking positions and swooped in on the terrorists which led to an exchange of fire. The terrorists attempted to escape but were intercepted and suppressed with a heavy volume of fire.” “Consequently, the gallant troops with reinforcement from 143 Battalion Gulak engaged the terrorists on Two Front Coordinated Attacks. The BHTs were completely routed by the troops, neutralizing many of them while others fled in disarray due to superior firepower.” “As a result, they hastily evacuated most of their corpses under the cover of darkness. The entire area has been dominated by Nigerian troops and the situation is completely under control.” “Items captured from the terrorists include One Ford vehicle, two Toyota Starlet vehicles loaded with foodstuffs, one motorcycle and one tyre inflating machine.
