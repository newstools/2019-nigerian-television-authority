The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Mr. Ayodeji Ajayi, disclosed this in his office in Ado Ekiti. He said that the state government paid N1,85O per student to cover both the administrative charges and other incidental expenses relating to the examination for each of 13,390 candidates. Ajayi, who warned that any school caught in examination malpractice would be punished accordingly, reminded the Principals of the position of the State government on examination malpractice. He said that the Kayode Fayemi-led administration has a zero tolerance for examination malpractice. The Permanent Secretary, however, disclosed that Vice Principals, who had served for over 20 years would henceforth be engaged in the supervision of Certificate Examinations in the State. He, therefore, called on Principals in the state not to collect any money from any candidate who would be writing the examination.
