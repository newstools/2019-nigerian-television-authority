Dr Dayo Oyeleye, an Abuja-based Psychologist, has encouraged Nigerians to always put a smile on each others’ faces as the country joins the rest of the world to mark International Day of Happiness. Celebrated annually on March 20 since 2013, the UN fixed the day to recognise the importance of happiness in the lives of people around the world. The day has ‘Happier Together’ as its theme for this year. The day was conceptualised and founded by philanthropist, activist, statesman, and prominent UN Special Advisor, Jayme Illien, to inspire, mobilise and advance the global happiness movement. Oyeleye, the President of Aspire Foundation, an NGO, told the News Agency of Nigeria on Wednesday in Abuja that happiness is important for healthy living. He said that cultivating the habit of making others happy was beneficial to the giver as it promotes a healthy lifestyle. He added that “studies have shown that happier people are more likely to eat healthier diets and it also promotes a range of lifestyle habits that are important for our overall health. “Being happy boosts one’s immune system combats stress, reduces blood pressure, as well as prolongs one’s life expectancy. “Making others happy around us could also transmit these health benefits to them. “We have a lot of Nigerians who are depressed in one way or the other, making them happy would lead to a more friendly and accommodating society.”
