Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has been enjoined to ensure the certification of all products from state owned and private enterprises in Cross River State under the Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) to promote their competitiveness locally and across the Nationâ€™s borders. The Executive Governor of the State, Professor Ben Ayade made this request during a visit to the SON exhibition stand at the recently held Job Festival and Entrepreneurship Summit at the Calabar International Convention Centre. The certification of the products of the recently established State owned enterprises for production of instant noodles, jute bags and packaging materials by SON as required by law, would also ensure that consumers get value for their money while promoting the growth of the enterprises through repeated patronage, according to him.
