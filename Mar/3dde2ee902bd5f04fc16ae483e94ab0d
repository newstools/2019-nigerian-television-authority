Retired Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, former Military President, has
commended Nigerians for their orderliness and peaceful conducts during
the 2019 general elections. According to the  News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) ,Babangida disclosed this in statement by Malam Zubairu Abdulra’uf,  his media aide in  Minna on Sunday. He urged all Nigerians to be the vanguards of peace for the development of the country through democratic processes. Babangida, who has been away for three months on a medical vacation abroad, returned to the country on March 9. He was received on arrival by former Head of State Gen. AbdulSalami
Abubakar, his son Muhammad Babangida and other family members and
friends. In 1987, nearly two years after assuming power as military leader,
Babangida spent weeks in the American Hospital in Paris, France,
obtaining treatment for a condition known as radiculopathy. Radiculopathy “is characterized by pain which seems to radiate from  the spine to extend outward to cause symptoms away from the source of  the spinal nerve root irritation.”
