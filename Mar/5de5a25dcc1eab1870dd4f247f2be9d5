President Muhammadu Buhari has given reasons he declined assent to five bills from the National Assembly. DAILY POST recalls that Buhari on Wednesday in a letter to the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, read at plenary declined assent to five bills . The newly rejected bills included: Nigerian Film Corporation Bill, Immigration (Amendment) Bill, Climate Change Bill, Chartered Institute of Pension Practitioners Bill as well as Digital Rights and Freedom Bill. On why he refused to sign the bills, Buhari said “I refused assent on the Immigration Bill because it would have adverse effect on Nigeria’s position on the ease of doing business ranking if signed into law. “ The Chartered Institute of Pension Practitioners Bill amounted to duplication of functions with an existing institute.” “Also, conflicting and duplication of duties of existing government agencies, their destructive nature, as well as lack of clarity in other bills.” In reaction, Saraki, who presided over the plenary, assured that the lawmakers would consider the report of the technical committee set up to look into rejected bills by the president.
