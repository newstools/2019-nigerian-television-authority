Civil servants in Kano State have urged the Federal Government to  ensure the speedy implementation of the new national minimum wage. Some of the workers told NAN in Kano on  Wednesday that the call was necessary to enable them to start enjoying  the wage. One of the workers at Radio Nigeria’s Kano Pyramid FM, Malam Bala
Abdullahi, said the call was also necessary to reduce the hardship being
experienced by workers in the country. “Things are costly, as you know the N18, 000 being paid to workers as
minimum wage is nothing to write home about in view of the high cost of
living. “So, we hope the Federal Government will ensure quick implementation
of the new national minimum wage as it will go a long way in enhancing
the living standards of workers,’’ he said. Another worker, Jafar Jikamshi, commended the National Assembly for
the speedy passage of the bill and called for its immediate
implementation. He, however, urged traders in the country not to increase prices of their commodities to enable workers enjoy the increase. “Traders in the country should have the fear of Allah by not increasing prices of essential commodities and services,” he said. Jikamshi said any attempt by traders to jerk up prices of commodities would render the new wage useless and ineffective. NAN reports that while Federal civil servants have expressed
happiness over the passage of the bill, state workers expressed
reservations over the readiness of the state government to implement the
new national minimum wage. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services. Henry is also proficient in use of most online journalism tools and Social media management. He currently serve as Information Technology Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network.
