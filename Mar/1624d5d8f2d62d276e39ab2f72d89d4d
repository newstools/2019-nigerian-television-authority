 The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, yesterday, declared a trading surplus of N12.13 billion in its financials for December 2018. In a statement on its Monthly Financial and Operations Report for December 2018, signed by its Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, the NNPC said its positive financial performance in the month under review was in spite of disturbing reports of breaches on its assets. Ughamadu attributed the positive swing to higher revenue numbers posted by the NNPC’s upstream subsidiary, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company, NPDC, which was targeting a 500,000 barrels per day, BPD, crude oil output by 2020. He cited NPDC’s continuous revenue drive arising from recent average weekly production of 332,000 BPD as the main driver of the positive outlook. Ughamadu stated that there appears to be no let-up in the activities of vandals who in December last year, pushed pipeline breaches across the country by a whopping 34 percentage point. He explained that within the period of December 2018, 257 pipeline points were vandalized, out of which one pipeline point failed to be welded and six pipeline points were ruptured, adding that this was compared to 197 breaches on it pipelines in November last year. He said, “Ibadan-Ilorin, Mosimi-Ibadan, and Atlas Cove-Mosimi network accounted for 90, 69 and 57 compromised points respectively or approximately 34 per cent, 26 per cent and 22 per cent of the vandalized points respectively. “Aba-Enugu pipeline link accounted for seven per cent, with other locations accounting for the remaining 11 per cent of the pipeline breaks. “Despite, the activities of the pipeline marauders, the NNPC continued to diligently monitor the daily stock of Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, otherwise called petrol, to achieve smooth distribution of petroleum products and zero fuel queue across the nation.” Ughamadu further stated that 1.80 billion litres of Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, translating to 58.17 million liters per day were supplied for the month, adding that overall, during the month under review, 1.96 billion litres of white products were distributed and sold by NNPC downstream subsidiary, Petroleum Products Marketing Company, PPMC, compared with 1.09 billion litres in November 2018. “This comprised 1.94 billion litres of PMS, 0.0070 billion litres of kerosene and 0.014 billion litres of diesel.
